# Blighthold-Elemental_BattleRoyale

In the first ages, with the first cities,
the largest and grandest of these sought greater and greater magical power to expand their realm.

They embued their magic into items, binding greater and greater energies as their knowledge grew,
but they were driven by greed and didn't consider the consequences of trying to conquer powers beyond what had been established by the earliest of mages.

The first city was swallowed by the voices of the damned.
When embedding time itself into magical items, in an effort to create magical items that can be used indefinitely,
the barriers of time were broken, long dead souls and magic amassed, taking over first only the castle where the research was being done,
The black winds, they call the voices of the damned, as they tare through the landscape, driven by madness and magic, growing with every soul and every piece of magic it consumes, the castle of its origin assuming the name: Blighthold.
