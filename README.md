# Blighthold-Elemental_BattleRoyale

In the first ages, with the first cities,
the largest and grandest of these sought greater and greater magical power to expand their realm.

They embued their magic into items, binding greater and greater energies as their knowledge grew,
but they were driven by greed and didn't consider the consequences of trying to conquer powers beyond what had been established by the earliest of mages.

The first city was swallowed by the voices of the damned.
When embedding time itself into magical items, in an effort to create magical items that can be used indefinitely,
the barriers of time were broken, long dead souls and magic amassed, taking over first only the castle where the research was being done,
The black winds, they call the voices of the damned, as they tare through the landscape, driven by madness and magic, growing with every soul and every piece of magic it consumes, the castle of its origin assuming the name: Blighthold.


Compiling instructions:

Blighthold runs on a custom ue4.18.3 found at:

https://github.com/windystrife/UnrealEngine_NVIDIAGameWorks.git

Follow the instructions for building the cutom engine in the link above.
Once built, run the custom egnine either through Visual Studio or its executable. After loading, a window will popup which can be used to navigate to this project and open it (however first ensure you can open some of the demo projects). You should now be able to open this projects uproject file to open the editor directly without having to open the custom ue4.18.3 first.

First time opening that build of ue4.18.3 can take several hours, and once launched it hangs at 45% for a long time the first time.

First time compiling and setting up DDC when opining Blighthold editor can take upwards of and hour, hanging most at 93-96% but subsequent launches are much quicker.
